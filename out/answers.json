Additionally, **Article 21** (right to life and personal liberty) is violated if torture occurs, as no person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.\n\nIf the torture is part of preventive detention, **Article 22(4)** may also be relevant, which limits the duration of preventive detention to three months unless an Advisory Board reports sufficient cause for further detention.\n\n(Note: The policy context does not explicitly mention torture, but these rights are violated if torture occurs in custody.)"

    "question": "How does Newton explain the perturbation of planetary orbits due to other planets?",
    "answer": "The excess of the greater impulses acting upon some bodies, and not acting upon others, must necessarily change their situation among themselves. And this perturbation, added to the perturbation arising from the inequality and inclination of the lines, makes the whole perturbation greater. If the parts of this system move in ellipses or circles without any remarkable perturbation, it is manifest that, if they are at all impelled by accelerative forces tending to any other bodies, the impulse is very weak, or else is impressed very near equally and in parallel directions upon all of them."

    "question": "How does Newton use the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion?",
    "answer": "Newton uses the concept of centripetal force to explain orbital motion by showing that a body can revolve in an immovable ellipsis, whose centre is the centre of force, if the centripetal force is reciprocally as the distance or as the square of the distance. For example, if the centripetal force is reciprocally as the distance, the angle between the upper and lower apsis will be 127 degrees, 16 minutes, and 45 seconds, and a body revolving with such a force will move alternately from the upper to the lower and from the lower to the upper apsis forever. Additionally, Newton demonstrates that if a body is acted upon by any centripetal force and another body ascends or descends in a right line, and their velocities are equal in one case of equal altitudes, their velocities will also be equal at all equal altitudes."

    "question": "How does Newton handle motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids?",
    "answer": "Newton discusses motion in resisting media, such as air or fluids, in several sections, including Section IV, where he explores the circular motion of bodies in resisting mediums, and Section VI, where he examines the motion and resistance of funependulous bodies. He uses mathematical demonstrations to describe the properties of fluids and the behavior of bodies in resisting media, such as air. For example, he notes that the common weights of bodies are nothing else but the excess of their true weights above the weight of the air. Additionally, he derives the ratio of the quantities of matter in funependulous bodies, whose centers of oscillation are equally distant from the center of suspension, as a ratio compounded of the ratio of the weights and the duplicate ratio of the times of the oscillations in vacuo."

    "question": "In what way does Newton's notion of absolute space and time differ from relative motion, and how does it support his laws?",
    "answer": "According to Newton, absolute, true, and mathematical time, of itself, and from its own nature flows equably without regard to anything external, and by another name is called duration. Relative, apparent, and common time, is some sensible and external measure of duration by the means of motion. \n\nAbsolute space is immovable and unchanging, whereas relative space is movable and changing. Newton distinguishes between absolute and relative motion. Absolute motion is the translation of a body from one absolute place into another, and relative motion is the translation from one relative place into another.\n\nThe effects that distinguish absolute from relative motion are the forces of receding from the axis of circular motion. In a true and absolute circular motion, these forces are present, but in a circular motion purely relative, they are not. Newton uses the example of a vessel with water to demonstrate this concept. When the vessel is whirled about, the water initially remains plain, but as the vessel communicates its motion to the water, the water begins to revolve and recede from the middle, forming a concave figure. This ascent of the water shows its endeavour to recede from the axis of its motion, and the true and absolute circular motion of the water may be measured by this endeavour. \n\nThis understanding of absolute space and time supports Newton's laws by allowing him to define true motion and rest, and to distinguish between them and relative motion and rest. This distinction is necessary for his laws of motion, as true motion is generated or altered only by forces impressed upon the body, whereas relative motion may be generated or altered without any force impressed upon the body."
