Q5: If my child is forced to work in a factory, is that legal?
A5: No, it is not legal. According to Article 24 of the Constitution of India, the prohibition of employment of children in factories or other hazardous occupations is explicitly stated. The context specifies that the health and strength of workers, including children, must not be abused, and citizens must not be forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength. Therefore, forcing a child to work in a factory violates this constitutional provision.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q6: If I am stopped from speaking at a protest, is that against my rights?
A6: Yes, if you are stopped from speaking at a protest, it may violate your rights under **Article 19(1)(a)** of the Constitution of India, which guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression. However, this right is subject to **reasonable restrictions** under **Article 19(2)**, which permits the State to impose restrictions in the interests of public order, sovereignty and integrity of India, or security of the State. If the restriction is arbitrary or disproportionate, it may be unconstitutional. The context does not specify the circumstances of the restriction, so further details would be required to determine its validity.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q7: If a religious place stops me from entering because I'm a woman, is that constitutional?
A7: No, subject to public order, morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part, all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess, practice and propagate religion; however, the State may make any law regulating or restricting any economic, financial, political or other secular activity which may be associated with religious practice, or providing for social welfare and reform or the throwing open of Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q8: If I change my religion, can the government stop me?
A8: No, the government cannot stop a person from changing their religion. The document does not mention any provisions that restrict an individual from changing their religion; in fact, it emphasizes promoting harmony and the spirit of common brotherhood amongst all the people of India, transcending religious diversities, as stated in Article 294 (e).
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q9: If the police torture someone in custody, what right is being violated?
A9: The right being violated is the protection of life and personal liberty, as no person shall be deprived of their life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law, as stated in the Constitution. Specifically, this right is protected under Article 21, which ensures that individuals are safeguarded against arbitrary detention and torture while in custody.
